This repository contains the data associated with the bioRxiv manuscript available at DOI xxxxx. For all datasets, methodology is described in full in this manuscript.

## Supplementary_Dataset_1.xlsx
Excel sheet of all 15,044 putative virus-derived RdRp ORFs with associated data. Details are provided in the README sheet of the Excel spreadsheet.

## Supplementary_Dataset_2.xlsx
Excel sheet containing the results of our BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990; Camacho et al., 2009) and HHSearch (Steinegger et al., 2019) verification of putative viral ORFs. Details are provided in the README sheet of the Excel spreadsheet.

## Supplementary_Dataset_3_cluster_trees
PhyML (Guindon & Gascuel, 2003; Guindon et al., 2010) phylogenetic trees of the different groups of classified virus-derived RdRp sequences. Core trimmed RdRp sequences were compared using Biopython pairwise global alignment (pw.aling.globalxx(sequence1, sequence2, one_alignment_only=True) and, where pairwise amino acid identities were â‰¥ 99.5%, the shorter of two sequences was removed.

## Supplementary_Dataset_4_pHMMs_and_alignments
The 77 viral RdRp pHMMs and their associated sequence alignments.
