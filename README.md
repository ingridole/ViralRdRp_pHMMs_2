## Supplementary_Dataset_1.xlsx
Excel sheet of all 15,044 putative virus-derived RdRp ORFs with associated data. Details are provided in the README sheet of the Excel spreadsheet.

## Supplementary_Dataset_2.xlsx
Excel sheet containing the results of our BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990; Camacho et al., 2009) and HHSearch (Steinegger et al., 2019) verification of putative viral ORFs. Details are provided in the README sheet of the Excel spreadsheet.

## Supplementary_Dataset_3_cluster_trees
PhyML (Guindon & Gascuel, 2003; Guindon et al., 2010) phylogenetic trees of the different groups of classified virus-derived RdRp sequences.

#### Subdirectories:
* tree_files:
	* \*.tre - nexus format tree file compatible with FigTree; sequences renamed as
     seq1, seq2, ...
  	* \*.names.txt - key linking seq1, seq2, ... tags to accession numbers and NCBI
     description lines

* alignments: core RdRp sequence alignments used to generate trees

* png_files: png images of phylogenetic trees

* svg_files: svg images of phylogenetic trees

## Supplementary_Dataset_4_pHMMs_and_alignments
